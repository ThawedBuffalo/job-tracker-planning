## Progress

### 2026-03-26 — Phase 1: Product Brief Complete

**Agent:** Saga (Product Brief)
**Brief Level:** complete

**Artifacts Created:**
- `design-artifacts/A-Product-Brief/project-brief.md` — Product brief
- `design-artifacts/A-Product-Brief/platform-requirements.md` — Platform requirements

**Summary:** Established the core product direction for `job-tracker-planning` as a responsive web/mobile-web workflow tool for individual technical job seekers. Locked the canonical application status model, email-notification scope, MVP boundaries, and single-VPS Flutter Web + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL delivery approach.

**Next:** Phase 2 — Trigger Mapping

### 2026-03-26 — Phase 2: Trigger Mapping Complete

**Agent:** Saga (Trigger Mapping)
**Personas:** 4 (Priya, Ethan, Clara, Ravi)
**Business Goals:** 3

**Artifacts Created:**
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/trigger-map.md` — Visual overview and strategic map
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/feature-impact-analysis.md` — Prioritized feature impact analysis
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/personas/02-priya-the-pipeline-optimizer.md` — Primary persona
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/personas/03-ethan-the-efficient-explorer.md` — Secondary persona
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/personas/03-clara-the-career-changer.md` — Secondary persona
- `design-artifacts/B-Trigger-Map/personas/04-ravi-the-remote-reacher.md` — Tertiary persona

**Summary:** Prioritized Priya as the primary design target, then mapped supporting behaviors for Ethan, Clara, and Ravi. Established four highest-impact workflow themes around fast capture, required-field completeness, guided next steps, and unified multi-source intake.

**Next:** Phase 3 — UX Scenarios

### 2026-03-26 — Phase 3: UX Scenarios Complete

**Agent:** Saga (Scenario Outline)
**Scenarios:** 4 scenarios covering 16 pages
**Quality:** Good

**Artifacts Created:**
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/00-ux-scenarios.md` — Scenario index
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/01-priyas-core-pipeline-momentum/01-priyas-core-pipeline-momentum.md` — Priya's Fast Job Entry
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/01-priyas-core-pipeline-momentum/1.1-home/1.1-home.md` — Scenario 01 first-step page outline
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/02-claras-follow-up-confidence-loop/02-claras-follow-up-confidence-loop.md` — Clara's Follow-Up Confidence Loop
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/02-claras-follow-up-confidence-loop/2.1-email-link-entry/2.1-email-link-entry.md` — Scenario 02 first-step page outline
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/03-ethans-required-field-fast-entry/03-ethans-required-field-fast-entry.md` — Ethan's Required-Field Fast Entry
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/03-ethans-required-field-fast-entry/3.1-job-url-paste/3.1-job-url-paste.md` — Scenario 03 first-step page outline
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/04-ravis-unified-global-entry/04-ravis-unified-global-entry.md` — Ravi's Unified Global Entry
- `design-artifacts/C-UX-Scenarios/04-ravis-unified-global-entry/4.1-job-url-paste/4.1-job-url-paste.md` — Scenario 04 first-step page outline

**Summary:** Created four persona-led storyboard scenarios covering fast entry, guided follow-up, required-field enforcement, and unified multi-source intake. Kept scope to a small dynamic app, used storyboard format throughout, and assigned all 16 scenario pages without duplication to preserve clean Phase 4 handoff.

**Next:** Phase 4 — UX Design

### 2026-03-27 — Epics & Stories Complete

**Agent:** Bob (BMad SM Agent)
**Epics:** 8 | **Stories:** 35 | **FRs Covered:** 54/54

**Artifacts Created:**
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` — Full epic and story breakdown

**Summary:** Expanded all 8 PRD epics into 35 implementation-ready stories with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria. Each story is scoped for a single dev-agent session, references the relevant FRs and Architecture decisions, and includes backend + Flutter implementation notes. Defined a 6-sprint delivery sequence (Sprint 0 infra → Sprint 5 notifications). All open architecture questions from the PRD are reflected in story constraints.

**Next:** Implementation — activate dev agent per sprint; start with Sprint 0 (E-008 infrastructure)

---

### 2026-03-27 — Architecture Document Complete

**Agent:** Winston (BMad Architect Agent)
**ADRs:** 10 Architecture Decision Records
**Schema:** 4 tables (users, applications, application_events, notification_log)
**API:** 18 endpoints across 5 resource groups

**Artifacts Created:**
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` — Full Architecture Document

**Summary:** Resolved all 6 PRD open questions (JWT refresh strategy, SMTP provider, URL parse fallback UX, stale notification frequency, dashboard sort, layout strategy). Defined complete PostgreSQL schema with Flyway migration plan, full REST API contract with request/response shapes, Spring Boot and Flutter project structures, Docker Compose production stack, implementation patterns (BLoC, service pattern, JWT interceptor), and next-step prompt lookup table for all 10 pipeline statuses.

**Next:** Epic & Story Elaboration — activate `*sm`

---

### 2026-03-27 — PRD Complete

**Agent:** John (BMad PM Agent)
**Epics:** 8 epics, 54 functional requirements, 10 non-functional requirement groups
**Stories:** 40 story headings (elaboration by SM agent)

**Artifacts Created:**
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md` — Full Product Requirements Document

**Summary:** Generated PRD from completed WDS Phases 1–3 (Product Brief, Trigger Map, UX Scenarios). Defined 6 functional requirement areas (Auth, Capture, URL Intake, Pipeline, Dashboard, Notifications), 8 implementation epics (E-001–E-008), and comprehensive NFRs covering performance, security, reliability, and maintainability. Captured 6 open architecture questions for Architect agent resolution.

**Next:** Architect Review — activate `*architect`; produce system architecture, OpenAPI spec, PostgreSQL schema

| 2026-03-26 | Priya selected as primary design target; trigger map expanded to four personas and feature priorities centered on guided workflow, required fields, and multi-source intake | Phase 2: Trigger Mapping | Saga + JC |
| 2026-03-26 | UX scenario plan fixed at 4 storyboard scenarios with persona-based naming and full 16-page coverage | Phase 3: Scenarios | Saga + JC |
| 2026-03-26 | Design intent set to Suggest (S) for all four scenarios to guide Phase 4 page design step-by-step | Phase 4 Prep: Handover | Saga + JC |

**Agent:** Freya (WDS Phase 4 — Handover)
**Delivery:** DD-001
**Scenarios packaged:** 4 (01 Priya, 02 Clara, 03 Ethan, 04 Ravi)
**Pages:** 16 specified

**Artifacts Created:**
- `design-artifacts/E-PRD/Design-Deliveries/DD-001-application-capture-and-follow-up.yaml`
- `design-artifacts/E-PRD/Design-Deliveries/TS-001-application-capture-and-follow-up.yaml`

**Summary:** Packaged all 16 Phase 4 page specs into a single Design Delivery covering authentication, application CRUD, URL parsing, email deep-link routing, required-field validation, and guided next-step recommendations. Test scenario covers 4 happy paths, 3 error states, 2 edge cases, 2 accessibility checks, and 2 usability tests.

**Next:** Phase 5 — Agentic Development (bmad-wds-agentic-development)

---

### 2026-03-26 — Design log initialized from completed Phase 1-3 artifacts
- Reason: no prior `_bmad-output/_progress/00-design-log.md` existed in the workspace
- Action: reconstructed baseline project progress from approved Product Brief, Trigger Map, and UX Scenario outputs
